# ⭐ 🔐 Remote IT Support — Executive Travel Security & Tenable Ops
 
> ## I am Jose G. (IT Specialist), responsible for securing CEO Alexander Pierce’s personal Windows 10 laptop during a business trip. I build a secure work profile to separate business from personal data, run Tenable scans to find and fix vulnerabilities, harden the system, configure secure remote access, set up a portable printer, and check hotel Wi-Fi for safety. This simulation lets me practice real-world IT security, protect sensitive data, and document my steps professionally for a complete IT portfolio.

## 🌐 Setup Remote Access — TeamViewer

> ## As part of this simulation, I set up secure remote access to a Windows 10 laptop using TeamViewer. I connected from my Windows 11 desktop to safely monitor, manage, and gather information on the laptop. This allowed me to practice remote IT management, ensure secure connectivity, and document my process for a simulated real-world remote IT support scenario.

> ### 🧰 I enable Remote Registry and other required Windows services.

<img width="504" height="32" alt="EvXiEg3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7611d80f-be45-4c42-af19-e4e95ec4ca0f" />

### 📝 Notes

> WMI allows Tenable credentialed scans even if Remote Registry is disabled.  
> Server service must be running for network shares and credentialed access.  
> Remote Registry being disabled on Windows 10 Home is expected and does not block scans.  
> Document system name from WMI output for portfolio verification.

---

> ### 🚫 I check if hotel Wi-Fi uses client isolation that blocks scanning.
<img width="620" height="226" alt="SohfBMK" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7800a32-82da-4aa0-9b78-bd52fa4a8f4c" />

### 📝 Notes

> Packet loss may indicate unstable network or issues with hotel Wi-Fi.  
> Use VPN or mobile hotspot if cloud.tenable.com cannot be reliably reached.  
> Ping results are important to document in the portfolio to show network readiness.  
> Note average latency and percentage of lost packets.


---

> ### 🔥 I identify firewall rules that may interrupt the credentialed scan.
