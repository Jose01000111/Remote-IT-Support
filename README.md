# 🎫 **TICKET 2 — Creation & Security of CEO-Work Windows Account**

> ### I build a secure, isolated work-only user account so the CEO’s business tasks stay protected and separate from personal activity.

> ### 🔧 I set up an optional local admin account for IT maintenance.  
> ### 🔑 I enforce a strong password policy with complexity and length.  
> ### 📁 I organize a clean folder structure for work documents and logs.

# 🎫 **TICKET 3 — Device Preparation for Tenable Credentialed Scan**

> ### I ensure the laptop can be credential-scanned by Tenable by enabling required services, verifying credentials, and confirming network accessibility.

> ### 🔑 I test admin credentials needed for authenticated scans.  
> ### 🧰 I enable Remote Registry and other required Windows services.  
> ### 🌐 I confirm the laptop can be reached through VPN or hotspot.  
> ### 🚫 I check if hotel Wi-Fi uses client isolation that blocks scanning.  
> ### 🔥 I identify firewall rules that may interrupt the credentialed scan.  
> ### 🛡️ I review UAC and security software to ensure nothing blocks Tenable.
